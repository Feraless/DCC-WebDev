The provided file, DCC Web.py, is the main Python file containing the flask code, which connects my website to the database. I have converted the PDF to CSV files, namely DCC 1.csv and DCC 2.csv, which have also been attached for reference. I have created 2 HTML files, namely home.html and about.html, which are present in the Templates folder. The home.html contains my main webpage, and when any form is submitted to the main page, the query goes to my Python file, from which Flask interacts with SQL and provides the solution on another page, namely about.html. There is no separate CSS file as it is integrated into home.html.
