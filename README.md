The provided file DCC Web.py is the main python file containing the flask code which connects my website to the database. I have converted the pdf to csv files namely DCC 1.csv and DCC 2.csv which have also beeen attached for reference. I have created 2 HTML files namely home.html and about.html which are present in the Tempaltes folder. The home.html contains my main webpage and when any form is submitted in the main page the query goes to my python file from which flask interacts with sql and provides the solution in another page namely about.html.
